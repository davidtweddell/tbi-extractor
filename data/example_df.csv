1001,"Findings: There is hyperattenuation predominantly involving the right sylvian fissure, left superior parietal sulci, right cingulate sulci and in the quadrigeminal cistern. There is layering hyperattenuation within the occipital horn of the left lateral ventricle. There is layering hyperattenuation in the suprasellar cistern. Hyperattenuation is noted around the partially visualized spinal cord. Foci of parenchymal hemorrhages are noted in the inferior right temporal lobe, left frontal lobe and the right subthalamic nuclei. There is no significant midline shift. The bony calvarium and the bones of the skull base appear normal. The visualized portions of the paranasal sinuses and the mastoid air cells are clear. No external soft tissue swelling. The orbits are unremarkable. There is a small amount of fluid in the right sphenoid sinus. Impression: 1. Multifocal subarachnoid hemorrhage as described above most notably in the right sylvian fissure and left superior parietal lobe. Hemorrhage is noted around the brainstem and cerebral convexities, right greater than left. Additional layering hemorrhage is noted in the occipital horn of the left lateral ventricle, suprasellar cistern and superior vermian cistern. 2. Multifocal parenchymal hemorrhages, most notably in the right temporal lobe, left frontal lobe, and right subthalamic nuclei. Findings are consistent with severe shear injury.",321306
1002,"Findings: There is no definite evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, midline shift or abnormal extraaxial fluid collection. There are numerous subtle punctate hyperdense foci scattered throughout the brain. The ventricles do not appear enlarged out of proportion to the cerebral sulci. Gray-white differentiation subtle a slightly decreased. There is subtle diffuse swelling of the brain. There are multiple skull base fractures and extensive facial fractures which will be more completely detailed on the accompanying facial bone CT reconstructions. There are mildly displaced bilateral frontal bone fractures through the anterior table of the frontal sinuses and nondisplaced fracture of the greater wing of the right sphenoid.. There are extensive sinus fractures with near complete opacification of the maxillary sinuses, ethmoid air cells, and sphenoid sinuses. There are a few scattered left ethmoid air cell opacities. Right ethmoid air cells are relatively clear.. There are multiple foci of subcutaneous emphysema and large dermal defects scattered throughout the frontal scalp and the soft tissues of the face with soft tissue edema. Impression: 1. No definite acute intracranial hemorrhage is identified. Several punctate densities could possibly represent early signs of hemorrhage, perhaps the earliest visual evidence for axonal injuries, but overall not definitive. 2. Suspicion for diffuse subtle edema of the brain without loss of all gray-white differentiation. This is a nonspecific finding that may represent the earliest indication of diffuse edema from trauma or hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, or some combination HIE and traumatic edema. 3. Complex facial and skull base fractures will be more completely detailed on the accompanying facial bones CT.",502453
